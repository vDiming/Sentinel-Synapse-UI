Custom Synapse X user interface, by me.
A custom Synapse X user interface with the following changes:

1. Sentinel
5. Synapse X library syntax highlighting within the AceEditor!
6. (Actually) working AceEditor script file system!
7. Built-in error help information!
8. Easy installation!
9. And much more!

# Installation
Simply download the exe simply from the github. Once done drag it into your Synapse X main directory make sure the "sxlibb.dll" file is also in your main Synapse X directory.

# Notes
For Support Join The Discord, sometimes when you first download it it will be buggy, but the support in the discord will help you find out what to do to fix the errors.
(Trust me the ui works you just need to install it right)

I will probably be updating this ui sometimes soon if people enjoy it and it gets me discord members lol (server link at top)

# AntiVirus
Just make sure it's excluded (ik sketch)
Virus Total: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/7a6e7ce0b1d27034eb2743bb25305b2ac9a9a950b3ccbb43d5d3c5ba2d43122d
If you still think it's a virus because Virus Total false flags it I will personally install it on screenshare and run it and any other files (involving this github).
